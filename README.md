# How EZ is it to get a SpringBoot CRUD REST API ?

## Notes

- The project is initially made to work with MySQL database.
- Feel free to change dependencies and application properties to match your preferred RDBMS.

## Running with MySQL default configuration

1. Either create a user with `user/user` as credentials or change the spring application properties to match your own credentials.
2. Run the sql script located in `/sql/MySqlScript.sql` in your MySQL database.
3. Ensure the url in spring application properties is correct (host and port).
4. Run the application (through CLI or your IDE as any SpringBoot application).
